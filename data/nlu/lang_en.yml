      Hi Oleksandr - I hope this message finds you well! I am reaching out in hopes to chat with you regarding a Software Engineering opportunity on our team here at Staircase. 

      This position is fully remote, and our team is globally distributed. To some this may be wonderful and to others they may be looking for an opportunity to return to an office. If this is not your cup of team no worries.

      We are a fintech startup modernizing the infrastructure for the US residential mortgage industry- one of the largest financial markets in the world, yet one of the most inefficient in terms of technology and innovation. We‚Äôre on a mission to rebuild the entire tech stack in order to make home buying more accessible, more affordable, and less stressful for all Americans (and someday hopefully, people in every country). 

      Our Engineers play a crucial role in helping us build a world-class product ecosystem for our customers and partners. Our tech stack includes python, AWS cloud native software/services.

      Your background in Python/AWS looks to be a great match for what we‚Äôre looking for. 

      We‚Äôve recently closed on our Series A funding with top tier investors (though it hasn‚Äôt been publicly announced), and we‚Äôre setting ourselves up for rapid growth. 

      I'd love to set up a call to share more details with you! Looking forward to hearing back.

      Senior Backend Developer - Berlin based - Relocation/ Remote starts available!
      Hi Oleksandr

      Hope you are well and having a good week so far?  I have come across your profile and you may be interested in a Senior Backend role I have available. Have you ever thought about relocation? (When easier to do so, remote starts!)

      I‚Äôm working with an established Berlin based company that offers intuitive software solutions and additional services for independent restaurateurs. Despite the industry being within hospitality they have been stable through out the current situation and Covid. You would be part of Europe's No. 1 iPad POS system. 

      They are looking for a Senior Backend Developer to join their international team! You would have strong experience with developing in APIs and micro services with Python/Django. Any experience with Java is a bonus as this is still used on smaller projects.

      You can be a part of a company with a flat hierarchy, an opportunity to create a leading solution, an international team and regular company events! 

      What are your thoughts?

      Hello Oleksandr,

      We founded a rapidly-growing SaaS start-up in the enterprise technology space, and have now opened an office in Lviv (~75 people) with plans to expand to Kyiv. We have an extremely strong team (ex-Stanford, Berkeley, etc.) with incredible revenue growth.

      From a technology perspective, we have a web and native mobile product, both Android and iOS. Our primary tech stack is Ruby on Rails, React, and Postgres deployed Heroku. But unlike other overseas companies, our product is made in Ukraine end-to-end, so we‚Äôre ramping up not only technical roles, but also UX, Design, Creative, Marketing and more importantly, Data Science.

      We‚Äôve heard through our network that you‚Äôve got the skills we‚Äôre looking for, so I wanted to reach out to see if you‚Äôre open to learning more about the role.

      Some bullets on the company:
      ‚Ä¢ We‚Äôve built an entirely new way for teams of all shapes and sizes to set and achieve goals
      ‚Ä¢ Customers include Siemens, Cisco, Stanford, the American Red Cross, etc.
      ‚Ä¢ Backed by top-tier venture + prominent private investors (lead Board Member of Amazon, President of IBM, Founder of Iconiq Capital, etc.)
      ‚Ä¢ Offices in San Francisco, Raleigh, Lviv and next Kyiv
      ‚Ä¢ Currently 120 full-time employees with a projected headcount of ~200 in the next year

      It‚Äôs worth noting that this is an equity-bearing position, so it will be highly lucrative for people joining at this stage. Please let me know if you‚Äôre interested, and I will have somebody from my team follow-up.

      Best,

      Oleksandr, could this be of interest?
      Oleksandr,

      Tech- Python, Java, Spring Boot, AWS, Kafka, Kinesis, DynamoDB & Cassandra.

      They are currently working remote due to Covid but this role will require relocating to Berlin. They will support your move as well as offer a very strong compensation package, flexible working arrangements as well as many other benefits but overall just an opportunity to work within a very cool and honest company.

      Senior Software Engineer with Python experience
      Dear Oleksandr,

      We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer with Python experience for our Danish client. 
      You will become a new team member at SafeOnline, the company that helps organizations stay compliant with Article 20 and more of the GDPR.

      Responsibilities:

      You will technically own (maintenance, delivery, future development) a live product with big loads of data flowing from 3rd party connectors to Elastic search indexing and AI algorithms.
      You'll predict the behaviour of the system when scaling it and translate findings into the best solutions.
      You'll integrate the product with more AI algorithms together with the AI team and within a microservice architecture.

      Conditions:

      Long-term
      On-site in Lviv, Ukraine (B2B contract) together with one more colleague who works on the same project
      Start as soon as possible

      Skills by importance:

      1. Event-based architectures. It would be best if you know Celery and RabbitMQ or Redis.
      2. Kubernetes. We will need to automate and autoscale big data.
      3. Python. Celery and Python are made for each other, so a non-python developer will not know Celery. But it can be someone good only on the Celery side and then we will see what we do with the integrations.

      Nice-to-have's:

      Query optimization for Elastic Search and MySQL 
      DevOps setup with Terraform
      Azure experience
      CI/CD with dockerized applications experience

      The company concentrates on a codeless approach and they have a specialist who will do all the coding when it comes to ML.

      Would this be relevant? If it is, please send your CV (and contact details) to na@fairpeople.com and my colleague Nick will get in touch with you shortly. 

      Kind regards,
